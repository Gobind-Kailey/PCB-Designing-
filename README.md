# PCB-Designing-
My first PCB design project, created to learn the basics of PCB layout, schematic capture, and manufacturing.



This project is my first attempt at designing a printed circuit board (PCB).  
The goal was to better understand how PCBs are made, starting from schematic capture in KiCad and moving into PCB layout and manufacturing preparation.
